ReactPixi made right
====================

This is a React binding for Pixi which does not have React hacked and backed-in. Also supports https://github.com/facebook/css-layout for layouting.

Inherit your component from ReactPixi.Container and use ReactPixi.Container, ReactPixi.Text and ReactPixi.Image in your components.

Render root node via `ReactPixi.render(React.createElement(MyRootComponent));`
